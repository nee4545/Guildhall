In the build I was mainly focused on making occupancy maps work.

To see this working:

-Click on play in the menu
-Move ur character by left clicking the mouse on the screen
-Get in the red sector of the AI and make the AI chase you
-Run away from the AI and get behid any obstaces in the map and hide behind it 
-The AI will create an occupancy map and try to find you
